# Conventional Commits

**REQUIRED**: You MUST use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for ALL commit messages. Never use generic terms like "update", "change", "modify" as commit types.

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Commit Types

**ONLY use these approved types** - never invent new types or use synonyms:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

**Forbidden types**: update, change, modify, add, remove, delete, improve, enhance - these are NOT valid types. Use `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, or `chore` instead.

## Scope (Optional)

The scope should be the name of the package/area affected (e.g., `api`, `ui`, `temporal`, `resume-form`).

## Subject

- Use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No dot (.) at the end
- Maximum 72 characters

## Body (Optional)

- Use imperative, present tense
- Explain the "what" and "why" vs. "how"
- Can include multiple paragraphs
- Wrap at 72 characters

## Footer (Optional)

- Reference issues: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`
- Breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>`

## Multiple Changes

When a commit includes multiple changes:
- If they're all the same type: use one commit with multiple scopes or a general scope
- If they're different types: split into separate commits OR use the most significant type with a descriptive subject

Example of multiple related changes:
```
